# Project Overview (GreenFlux Smart Charging Assignment)

Welcome to GreenFlux Smart Charging! This project is a well-structured and easily deployable solution designed to run seamlessly without any installation or dependency issues. Leveraging the power of Sqlite as its database and Docker Compose for containerization, it ensures a smooth deployment experience through Docker.

## Features

- **Database Technology**: The project relies on Sqlite, a lightweight, file-based database system that provides efficiency!

- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker Compose is employed to encapsulate the application and its dependencies, streamlining the deployment process. This allows for easy scaling and ensures consistent performance across different environments.

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: The development process adheres to the principles of Test-Driven Development. This means that comprehensive unit tests, written using xUnit, cover the entire source code. TDD not only guarantees the reliability of the code but also accelerates the development cycle.

- **Domain Driven Design (DDD)**: The codebase is structured following the principles of Domain Driven Design. This approach enhances the readability, maintainability, and scalability of the code. By aligning the code structure with the problem domain, it becomes more intuitive and easier to evolve as requirements change.
